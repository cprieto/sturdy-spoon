This is the source code for my final project for the BSc. in Computer Sciences, a simple but nice tracker application showing how to use CRDT to share a common document between co-editors in a non-traditional CRDT application, in this case, a music tracker application.

No central server communication is required (only to serve the documents through simple HTTP protocol) and the communication and sharing is done _peer-to-peer_ using WebRTC.
